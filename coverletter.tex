    I am excited to apply for the Automation Engineer Intern opportunity in Intel's Systems Engineering Validation team as seen on the UofT's Engineering job board. I am currently a third-year Computer Science specialist in the PEY Co-op program at the University of Toronto Mississauga. From my studies so far, I have learnt a strong understanding of object-oriented programing, data structures and computer infrastructure, and am looking forward to learning about new technologies to improve myself. As someone who is interested in exploring new technologies that pushes the limit, Intel is the perfect as it values innovation and includes diversity. The Automation Engineer Intern position would allow me to build upon what I have learnt at school while contributing my knowledge, skills, and unique outlook to help drive innovation in your company.

    During my time interning at the Nexle, I was able to apply my knowledge of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, SQL and MySQL, to assist in developing content management systems for the companies clients. In addition, I had the opportunity to join a Scrum team and experience Agile methodology which gave me a better understanding of project management and significantly improved my communication. When the team was asked to redesign the database and back-end, I proposed an improvement in the relationships between objects. As a result, it improves the speed of the back-end and reduces confusion for developers in the team.

    In addition to my technical knowledge, I can bring effective communication and innovative ideas. In my role as a Tech Associate at the Mathematical, Computer Science, and Statistic Academic Society,  I organized the Deer Hacks hackathon that had over 300 participants and 50 entries. Through this experience, I was able to effectively implement my creative ideas in the inner workings of the hackathon. I hope to provide the same ideas and professionalism as an Automation Engineer Intern at your company.

    I am an innovative problem-solver, effective communicator and curious learner, eager to take on new challenges and contribute to Intel's mission. Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to hearing from you and can be contacted via email (\href{mailto:mnkhoi.nguyen@mail.utoronto.ca}{mnkhoi.nguyen@mail.utoronto.ca}) to discuss this co-op opportunity in further detail.

    Sincerely,

    Khoi Nguyen
