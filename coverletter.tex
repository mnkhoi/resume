    % I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer opportunity in Twilio Engineering's team as seen on the company's job board. I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science specialist at the University of Toronto. From my studies so far, I have learnt a strong understanding of object-oriented programing, data structures and computer infrastructure, and am looking forward to learning about new technologies to improve myself. As someone who is interested in exploring new technologies that pushes the limit, Twilio is the perfect as it values innovation and includes diversity. The Software Engineering position would allow me to build upon what I have learnt at school while contributing my knowledge, skills, and unique outlook to help drive innovation in your company.

    % During my time interning at AMD, I was able to apply my knowledge of programming languages and technologies, including Ruby, Golang, Typescript, Node.js, C++ and SQL, to assist in developing tooling for the SOC DV infrastructure team. In addition, I had the opportunity to bring up new project initiatives such as LSF Monitor that can help greatly improve the developer experience in the team. And an organization chart with roles and permissions services for the current tools that we have as the team grows.

    % During my time interning at the Nexle, I was able to apply my knowledge of programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, SQL and MySQL, to assist in developing content management systems for the companies clients. In addition, I had the opportunity to join a Scrum team and experience Agile methodology which gave me a better understanding of project management and significantly improved my communication. When the team was asked to redesign the database and back-end, I proposed an improvement in the relationships between objects. As a result, it improves the speed of the back-end and reduces confusion for developers in the team.

    % In addition to my technical knowledge, I can bring effective communication and innovative ideas. In my role as a Tech Associate at the Mathematical, Computer Science, and Statistic Academic Society,  I organized the Deer Hacks hackathon that had over 300 participants and 50 entries. Through this experience, I was able to effectively implement my creative ideas in the inner workings of the hackathon. I hope to provide the same ideas and professionalism as an Software Engineer at your company.

    % I am an innovative problem-solver, effective communicator and curious learner, eager to take on new challenges and contribute to Twilio's mission. Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to hearing from you and can be contacted via email (\href{mailto:bob.k.nguyen@gmail.com}{bob.k.nguyen@gmail.com}) to discuss this new graduate position in further detail.

%     I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Engineering New Grad, Applied AI role at OpenAI. As a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Toronto, I have developed a strong technical foundation through my coursework and extensive hands-on experience, particularly with React and JavaScript. My work at Nexle Corporation involved programming the front-end of a content management system using React and Redux, and at AMD, I built a Jira Bug Tracking Service with a React frontend. The opportunity to contribute to a team dedicated to advancing artificial general intelligence in a safe and beneficial way aligns perfectly with my skills and my passion for building technology that empowers people.
%
% During my internship at AMD, I was part of a team that built the 'Matrix' event-driven automation framework in Go and SQLite3. This project taught me the importance of designing scalable systems that can simplify complex workflows for large teams. My experience in a large-scale enterprise environment, coupled with my work on the DynamoHub project where I designed a real-time system with data ingestion from edge devices to a cloud backend, has prepared me to tackle the challenging and multi-faceted problems at OpenAI.
%
% I am particularly drawn to this role because of my deep interest in the application of AI to real-world problems and bringing AI to a global user base. I am currently taking classes on the practical application of AI, and I am fascinated by the potential for AI to bridge the gaps in access to information and resources. The idea of contributing to a future where AI is a universally accessible tool for progress and creativity is what drives my work.
%
% I thrive in a fast-paced environment where I can contribute to a company's success while also growing as a software engineer. My diverse background in building both front-end and back-end systems, working with languages like Go and Python, and my experience in collaborative, team-based projects make me confident that I can be a valuable contributor to your team. I am a self-starter who is always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. I am excited by the prospect of growing my skills and contributing to OpenAI's mission.
%
% Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Alumni Ventures. With a background in building event-driven frameworks, distributed systems, and full-stack applications, I thrive in fast-moving environments where engineers own problems end-to-end and see their impact immediately. Alumni Ventures’ mission to power innovative startups with technology resonates strongly with me, and I am eager to contribute my skills to your team.

In my role as a Hardware Verification Intern at AMD, I designed and implemented “Matrix,” an event-driven automation framework in Go and SQLite that streamlined debugging workflows for over 100 engineers. This experience sharpened my skills in system design, APIs, and automation. More recently, I led DynamoHub, a student project where my team built a traffic management platform using Kafka, AWS IoT Core, Jetson Nano, Flask, and PostgreSQL for real-time updates. These projects demonstrate my ability to design data pipelines, integrate across cloud and edge systems, and deliver reliable solutions under tight timelines.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a mindset of curiosity and ownership. At XtayPro Canada, I built and deployed the company website using Next.js and Tailwind while also setting up workflows and tools for a small startup team. I thrive in environments with ambiguity, where I can identify challenges, propose solutions, and drive them to completion. I also embrace AI tools in my workflow as accelerators-whether for validating design decisions or generating test scaffolding-while ensuring I deeply understand and refine the code.

I would be thrilled to bring this mix of technical depth, startup experience, and problem-solving mindset to Alumni Ventures. I am eager to learn from your team of seasoned engineers while contributing to the mission-driven technology that powers investments and entrepreneurship.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background aligns with Alumni Ventures’ goals.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
