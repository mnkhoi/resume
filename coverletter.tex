I am excited to apply for the New Grad Software Engineer position at Pinterest. I am a graduating Computer Science from University of Toronto. I've always admired Pinterest's mission of helping people discover and bring their ideas to life, and I'm inspired by the scale of technology that powers that experience. The opportunity to work on products that millions of people use daily strongly interests me to contribute my skills to your team.

My recent internship at AMD was in hardware verification, but much of my work focused on building infrastructure and web tools that made engineers more productive. I created internal websites and automation frameworks (Matrix) that streamlined workflows for large teams for the biggest project in AMD up until now. This gives me experience with backend development, APIs, and scalable systems. In addition, I've led group projects in my Software Engineering courses that connected cloud technologies like AWS IoT Core and Kafka to real-time applications, deepening my understanding of distributed systems and modern development practices.

I believe this mix of experience developing internal tools, working on infrastructure, and tackling data heavy problems aligns well with Pinterest's engineering environment. I am eager to bring my curiosity, problem solving skills, and technical background to Pinterest, contributing to both the mission and the growth of the engineering team while continuing to learn from seniors engineers.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences can support Pinterest's mission and technology.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
