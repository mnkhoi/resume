I am Khoi Nguyen, a 4th year student at the University of Toronto, and I want to express my interst to apply for the Software Engineering Intern position at Pinterest over the 2026 Winter term. I have always liked Pinterest's mission to inspire creativity and help people bring their ideas to life, and I am interested in the scale and impact of the technology that makes that possible. I enjoy building systems that is performant, nicely design, and reliable, I'm eager to contribute my skills and grow within Pinterest's innovative engineering culture.

In my internship at AMD in the SOC Verification Infrastructure team, I developed infrastructure tools for high-performance compute environments, improving system performance by 300\% and helping over 200 engineers manage large-scale simulation workloads. I also designed and published Matrix, an event-driven automation framework in Go that used RabbitMQ and SQLite to orchestrate communication and debugging workflows across distributed systems. These experiences strengthened my foundation in backend development, system design, and debugging in complex data environments.

Outside of work, I led a student project called DynamoHub, where I designed a realtime AI traffic management platform. My team built an edge computing system using Jetson Nano, Docker, Flask, and AWS IoT Core, connected through Kafka for realtime updates. This project allowed myself to explore my interest in scalable systems, cloud computing, and data-driven architectures areas which I know are central to Pinterest's engineering challenges.

I'm motivated by the opportunity to learn from talented engineers at Pinterest. I bring hands-on experience with Go, Python, React, and distributed cloud systems, and a drive to tackle challenging engineering problems.

Thanks for your consideration for the Software Engineering role at Pinterest. If you have any questions about my experiences feel free to reach out at \href{mailto:bob.k.nguyen@gmail.com}{bob.k.nguyen@gmail.com}.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
