I'm writing to apply for the Software Engineer position at OKX. I've been following the growth of crypto and blockchain technology for some time, and I believe it represents one of the most exciting frontiers in technology today. The idea of working on the systems that make crypto accessible and reliable for millions of people is something I would be proud to contribute to.

My background is in computer science and mathematics from the University of Toronto, combined with hands-on experience building distributed systems and cloud-based applications. At AMD, I designed an event-driven automation framework in Go that improved engineering workflows for large teams. I also worked on DynamoHub, where I led a team to build a real-time data pipeline using AWS IoT Core, Kafka, Flask, and PostgreSQL. These projects gave me the skills to design scalable backends, work with real-time systems, and contribute across the stack.

I'm eager to apply that experience to the unique challenges of building in crypto-whether that means designing efficient APIs, ensuring reliability at scale, or integrating complex systems that handle large volumes of data securely. I enjoy solving hard problems, learning quickly, and taking ownership of my work, which I know is a strong fit for a fast-paced environment like OKX.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to bring both my technical background and my enthusiasm for crypto to your engineering team.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
