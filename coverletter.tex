I am Khoi Nguyen, a 4th year computer science student at Univerity of Toronto. I am excited to apply for the Backend Software Engineer position at Apple. I have always admired Apple’s ability to combine cutting-edge technology with seamless user experiences, and I am eager to contribute my skills in backend development, distributed systems, and high-performance computing to support that mission.

In my internship at AMD, I worked for the RTGSOC Design Verification Infrastructure team, created tools for high-performance compute data centers, where I designed and maintained infrastructure that improved engineering workflows at scale for the biggest project (datacenter GPU) at AMD up to date. I also built and debugged System-on-Chip (SoC) verification testbenchs reaching 250Gbs size, which required careful optimization and strong problem-solving skills when working with very large files. These experiences strengthened my ability to design performant systems and sharpened my debugging skills in complex, performance-critical environments.

I have experience building distributed data systems in my projects, where Ideveloped a real-time data system for UrbanDynamo. This involved using Kafka and deploying to the cloud and managing the cloud. I also bring Java experience from designing and building platformer games, which gave me a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and software design patterns. Through these experiences, I have always wanted hard engineering problems where performance, scalability, and reliability matter most.

I want to contribute to Apple because of the opportunity to work on backend systems that serve millions of users while maintaining the high standards of performance and reliability the company is known for. I am motivated by the chance to contribute to that scale, while continuing to grow as an engineer alongside some of the most talented teams in the world. I know that there is always room to improve and I fully believe that Apple is the right place for me to do that with the best engineers around me.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in distributed systems, debugging, and backend development can contribute to Apple’s engineering challenges.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
