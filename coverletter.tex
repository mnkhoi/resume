I am Khoi Nguyen, a 4th year student at the University of Toronto, and I want to express my interest in Software Engineering at Apple's Services Rotational Program. As a student, I am passionate about solving complex technical problems and building reliable, user-focused software. I'm drawn to Apple's commitment to innovation, quality, and seamless user experiences. The opportunity to contribute across different software teams, helping each shaping products that impact millions of people, aligns perfectly with both my technical background and my desire to continue learning from world-class engineers.

During my internship at AMD, I worked on infrastructure for running simulations for high-performance compute data centers, designing analytics platform LSF Monitor that supported tracking jobs at the data center for over 200 engineers. I co-developed Matrix, an event-driven automation framework built in Go and RabbitMQ, which streamlined debugging and communication based on events. These experiences gave me strong foundations in backend development, concurrency, and large-scale system reliability which I think fits perfectly in Apple Services and the products we are building.

In addition, I've worked across the stack, building full-stack web applications using Flask, FastAPI, React, and AWS. My current academic project involves developing a database engine in C++, which has deepened my understanding of operating systems, performance optimization, and low-level data structures. Through these experiences, I developed a passion for building systems with high user impact which is something I see reflected in Apple's engineering philosophy.

What excites me most about Apple is the chance to work on products that people truly love and rely on every day, while continuously rotating through teams that challenge me to grow as an engineer. I bring experience with backend systems, strong debugging skills from working on large SoC verification projects, and an eagerness to contribute to the software that defines Apple's ecosystem.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I would be thrilled to bring my skills, curiosity, and passion for engineering excellence to Apple Services Rotational Program.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
