I'm a Khoi Nguyen, a fourth year student at University of Toronto, and I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Reach Financial. I'm feel close to Reach's mission to help people take control of their finances and outsmart debt through technology. As someone passionate about using engineering to solve meaningful real-world problems, I want to contribute my technical skills while learning from your team alongside helping build products that affects people's life.

During my internship at AMD, I built and maintained infrastructure tools for high-performance compute systems, including an event-driven automation framework in Go, Python, and RabbitMQ that streamlined workflows for over 100 engineers. I also developed backend services and API using object oriented programming in Python (FastAPI, Flask) for real-time data systems which involves Kafka, AWS IoT Core, and PostgreSQL. These experiences strengthened my understanding of algorithms, data modeling, and large-scale system design-skills that could benefit Reach Financial.

In addition to my backend experience, I have worked with React and TypeScript in developing full-stack web applications, and I'm proficient in version control, testing, and collaborative development using Git and GitHub. I truly believe that I can help Reach improve the experience for our users and bring new helpful products to them. But I'm most excited about the opportunity to grow in an environment that values both technical excellence and a strong engineering culture.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I would be thrilled to contribute to Reach Financial's goal of helping people control their finances while also growing and learning best practices to become a better engineer.

Thank you for considering my application. I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my background and interests align with the needs of your team.

Sincerely,

Khoi Nguyen
